## 🏎️ Weight vs Acceleration Scatter Plot

This project visualizes the relationship between a car’s **weight** and its **acceleration** using a scatter plot, based on real-world automotive data from the late 1970s and early 1980s.

---

### 📊 Features

* Scatter plot using **Matplotlib**
* Real-world car dataset (MPG dataset)
* Shows how vehicle weight impacts acceleration
* Clean and beginner-friendly code

---

### 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: [Seaborn's `mpg.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mpg.csv)
* **Fields used**:

  * `weight`: Weight of the car
  * `acceleration`: Time taken to reach speed

---

### 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python weight_vs_acceleration.py
```

---

### 📈 Output

A scatter plot that displays:

* **X-axis**: Vehicle weight
* **Y-axis**: Acceleration
* Each dot = one car

---

### 💡 Observations (Optional)

You may notice that **heavier cars tend to have lower acceleration**, suggesting an inverse relationship.
